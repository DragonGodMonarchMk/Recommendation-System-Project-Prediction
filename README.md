# Recommendation-System-Project-Prediction
# üì¢ Recommendation System Project ‚Äî Collaborative Filtering & Content-Based Models

An end-to-end machine learning project building a hybrid recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Matrix Factorization techniques. The system aims to predict user preferences and suggest products/items tailored to individual user profiles.

## üöÄ Project Overview
- Built **User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering models** using cosine similarity.
- Developed a **Content-Based Recommendation Engine** leveraging TF-IDF vectors on product metadata.
- Implemented **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** for latent factor modeling.
- Designed evaluation metrics including **RMSE, Precision@K, Recall@K, Coverage**.
- Explored hybrid strategies combining collaborative and content-based approaches for optimal recommendations.
- Visualized recommendation results using **seaborn heatmaps and similarity matrices**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise Library)**
- **Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF Vectorization)**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Development Environment)

| Component                             | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collaborative Filtering (User & Item) | Predicting preferences based on user-user/item-item similarities   |
| Content-Based Filtering               | Recommending items based on product metadata similarity            |
| Matrix Factorization (SVD)            | Decomposing sparse user-item matrix for latent factor modeling     |
| Similarity Metrics                    | Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation                             |
| Evaluation Metrics                    | RMSE, Precision@K, Recall@K, Coverage                              |
| Business Applications                 | Personalized Recommendations, Increased User Retention             |

## üìà Results & Insights
